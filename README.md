# Start Here

## Install dependencies

`npm install .`

## Run app

`npm start`


## Design
Plain React was used for this building this app.
The top most component Game holds the game state.
The board is a matrix of objects representing each of the cells.
Every time a cell is clicked, the new state of the board is calculated from the previous one.
Thanks to React virtual DOM, changing a piece of the state would not mean all the existing
DOM elements would be destroyed and re created.

## Performance optimization
The app runs well with 100x100 and 200x200. But that's as far as it gets.
A further optimization would imply to virtualize the board. The user would get a viewport 
of 20x20 (or similar) and buttons to scroll horizontally and vertically to other parts of 
the board. The Game component would still hold a complete game state, including all cells
in the board, but only a subset of the cells would be rendered at a given time.

There was not enough time to implement such an optimization, but I'm confident it would
support 1000 x 1000 boards and beyond.

## TODO
Ideally every component should live in its own file, but this was a race against time so 
all components are on Main.js

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
